# Banking-Management-System
Design and Development of Banking Management System

The Banking Management System aims to simulate the core functionalities of a bank, including customer account management, transactions, loan processing, and administrative oversight. The system features secure login mechanisms and role-based access for customers, employees, managers, and administrators. The focus is on ensuring data consistency, security, and correct handling of race conditions using file management, locking mechanisms, and process synchronization.

Roles:

1.	Customer: Customers log in using their credentials and have access to banking operations such as viewing account balances, depositing or withdrawing money, transferring funds, and applying for loans. The system ensures proper locking mechanisms to avoid race conditions when performing concurrent operations.

Technical Requirements:

•	System Calls: Use system calls instead of library functions wherever possible, including process management, file management, file locking, semaphores, multithreading, and inter-process communication mechanisms.
