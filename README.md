Design and Development of Banking Management System

The Banking Management System aims to simulate the core functionalities of a bank, including customer account management, transactions, loan processing, and administrative oversight. The system features secure login mechanisms and role-based access for customers, employees, managers, and administrators. The focus is on ensuring data consistency, security, and correct handling of race conditions using file management, locking mechanisms, and process synchronization.
